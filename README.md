# Scalo
This repository contains the UI for a browser-based language project. This was started in January of 2018 as an undegraduate research project, which I have continued to develop since. The Scalo language simplifies the process of creating scalable images that involve repetitive patterns, such as gridlines or concentric circles. It also provides support for scalable animations in a limit-based format.
