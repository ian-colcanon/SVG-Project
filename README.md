# svg_lang
A language designed for creating SVG-based animations. 

This repository contains my personal research on lexers, parsers, and compilers for a team research project started in January of 2018. 
The goal of this project is to design a language that simplifies the process of creating scalable images that involve repetitive patterns, 
such as gridlines or concentric circles. The language will also provide support for scalable animations in a limit-based format.
